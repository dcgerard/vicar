## Description
Let

Y = XB + ZA + E,

for

* Y an n by p matrix of gene expression data with n samples and p genes,
* X an n by q matrix of q covariates,
* B a q by p matrix of unobserved coefficients for the observed covariates,
* Z an n by k matrix of hidden confounders,
* A a k by p matrix of hidden coefficients for the hidden confounders, and
* E an n by p matrix of independent normal errors with column variances s1,...,sp.

Not accounting for the hidden covariates, Z, can reduce power and
result in poor control of false discovery rate. This package provides
a suite of functions to adjust for hidden confounders, both when one
has and does not have access to control genes.

The functions `mouthwash` and `backwash` can adjust for hidden confounding when one
does not have access to control genes. They do so via non-parametric
empirical Bayes methods that use the powerful methodology of Adaptive
SHrinkage [@stephens2016false] within the factor-augmented regression
framework described in @wang2015confounder. `backwash` is a slightly more 
Bayesian version of `mouthwash`.

When one has control genes, there are many approaches to take. Such
methods include RUV2 [@gagnon2012using], RUV4 [@gagnon2013removing],
and CATE [@wang2015confounder]. This package adds to the field of
confounder adjustment with control genes by

1. Implementing a version of CATE that is calibrated using control genes similarly to the method in @gagnon2013removing. The function is called `vruv4`.
2. Introduces RUV3, a version of RUV that can be considered both RUV2 and RUV4. The function is called `ruv3`.
3. Introduces RUV-impute, a more general framework for accounting for hidden confounders in regression. The function is called `ruvimpute`
4. Introduces RUV-Bayes, a Bayesian version of RUV. The function is called `ruvb`.

## Installation

To install, first install `sva` and `limma` from Bioconductor
in R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("limma", "sva"))
```

Also install the cate R package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cate")
```

Then run in R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/vicar")
```

## Vignettes
I've provided three vignettes to help you get started with vicar. By default, the vignettes are not built when you use `install_github`. To build the vignettes during installation, run
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/vicar", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
Note that this will result in a somewhat slower install. The first vignette, _sample\_analysis_, gives a sample analysis using vicar to account for hidden confounding. The second vignette, _customFA_, gives a few instructions on how to incorporate user-defined factor analyses with the confounder adjustment procedures implemented in vicar. The third vignette, _custom\_prior_, gives instructions and examples on incorporating a user-specified prior into `ruvb`. To see these vignettes after install, run
```{r, eval = FALSE}
utils::vignette("sample_analysis", package = "vicar")
utils::vignette("customFA", package = "vicar")
utils::vignette("custom_prior", package = "vicar")
```
