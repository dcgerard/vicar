Description: Implements many methods for accounting for unobserved confounding
             in linear regression. If control genes are available, then the
             following methods are implementable: a calibrated version of
             CATE/RUV4 (vruv4), a Bayesian version of RUV (ruvb), a version of
             RUV that unifies other versions of RUV (ruv3), and a generalized
             version of RUV (ruvimpute). If control genes are not available,
             then MOUTHWASH (mouthwash) and BACKWASH (backwash) are excellent
             procedures to use as long as only one covariate is of interest.
