Description: Implements many methods for accounting for unobserved confounding
             in linear regression. If control genes are available, then the
             following methods are implementable: a calibrated version of
             CATE/RUV4 vruv4(), a Bayesian version of RUV ruvb(), a version of
             RUV that unifies other versions of RUV ruv3(), and a generalized
             version of RUV ruvimpute(). If control genes are not available,
             then MOUTHWASH mouthwash() and BACKWASH backwash() are excellent
             procedures to use as long as only one covariate is of interest.
             The methods are described in detail in Gerard and 
             Stephens (2020) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy029> and Gerard and 
             Stephens (2021) <doi:10.5705/ss.202018.0345>.
