\title{A simulated RNA-seq dataset.}
\format{A list with the following elements
\describe{
    \item{Y}{A matrix of gene expression levels whose rows index the samples and whose columns index the genes.}
    \item{X}{A matrix of covariates. The first column is a vector of ones for an intercept term and the second column is a "treatment" indicator.}
    \item{ctl}{A logical vector where a \code{TRUE} at location \eqn{i} indicates the prensence of a control gene at location \eqn{i} in \code{Y} and a \code{FALSE} at location \eqn{i} indicates the absence of a control gene at location \eqn{i} of \code{Y}.}
    \item{beta}{The two effect sizes for treatment vs control.}
    \item{which_null}{A logical vector where a \code{TRUE} indicates the location of a null gene.}
