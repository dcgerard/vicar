\item{Y21}{Top left of matrix.}

\item{Y31}{Bottom left of matrix.}

\item{Y32}{Top right of matrix.}

\item{k}{The rank of the mean matrix.}

\item{nsamp}{A positive integer. The number of samples to draw.}

\item{burnin}{A positive integer. The number of early samples to
discard.}

\item{thin}{A positive integer. We will same the updates of
\code{Y22} every \code{keep} iteration of the Gibbs sampler.}

\item{display_progress}{A logical. Should we print a text progress
bar to keep track of the Gibbs sampler (\code{TRUE}) or not
(\code{FALSE})? Also, if \code{TRUE}, then you can interrupt the
C++ code every 1\% of runtime.}

the precisions.}

expansion.}

\item{use_code}{A character. Should we use the C++ code
(\code{"cpp"}) or the R code (\code{"r"})?}

\description{
"bfl" = "Bayesian factor loading"
}
\details{
This is as simple as they come. I put normal priors on the loadings
and factors and gamma priors on the precisions. The hyperparameters
are set to provide weak prior information by default.

The main difference between this version and others is that the
factors are a prior assumed to have the same variances as the data
observations. This might be distasteful to some.

This also has parameter expansion implemented and is written in
compiled code. To see a slower version without parameter expansion,
go to \code{\link{bfl}}.
