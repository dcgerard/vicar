\usage{
vruv2_old(
  Y,
  X,
  ctl,
  k = NULL,
  cov_of_interest = ncol(X),
  likelihood = c("t", "normal"),
  limmashrink = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A matrix of numerics. These are the response variables
where each column has its own variance. In a gene expression
study, the rows are the individuals and the columns are the
genes.}

\item{X}{A matrix of numerics. The covariates of interest.}

\item{ctl}{A vector of logicals of length \code{ncol(Y)}. If
position i is \code{TRUE} then position i is considered a
negative control.}

\item{k}{A non-negative integer.The number of unobserved
confounders. If not specified and the R package sva is
installed, then this function will estimate the number of
hidden confounders using the methods of Buja and Eyuboglu
(1992).}

\item{cov_of_interest}{A vector of positive integers. The column
numbers of the covariates in X whose coefficients you are
interested in. The rest are considered nuisance parameters and
are regressed out by OLS.}

\item{likelihood}{Either \code{"normal"} or \code{"t"}. If
\code{likelihood = "t"}, then the user may provide the degrees
of freedom via \code{degrees_freedom}.}

\item{limmashrink}{A logical. Should we apply hierarchical
shrinkage to the variances (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE})?
If \code{degrees_freedom = NULL} and \code{limmashrink = TRUE}
and \code{likelihood = "t"}, then we'll also use the limma
returned degrees of freedom.}

\item{degrees_freedom}{if \code{likelihood = "t"}, then this is the
user-defined degrees of freedom for that distribution. If
\code{degrees_freedom} is \code{NULL} then the degrees of
freedom will be the sample size minus the number of covariates
minus \code{k}.}

\item{include_intercept}{A logical. If \code{TRUE}, then it will
check \code{X} to see if it has an intercept term. If not, then
it will add an intercept term. If \code{FALSE}, then \code{X}
will be unchanged.}

\item{gls}{A logical. Should we estimate the part of the
confounders associated with the nuisance parameters with gls
(\code{TRUE}) or with ols (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{fa_func}{A factor analysis function. The function must have
as inputs a numeric matrix \code{Y} and a rank (numeric scalar)
\code{r}. It must output numeric matrices \code{alpha} and
\code{Z} and a numeric vector \code{sig_diag}. \code{alpha} is
the estimate of the coefficients of the unobserved confounders,
so it must be an \code{r} by \code{ncol(Y)} matrix. \code{Z}
must be an \code{r} by \code{nrow(Y)} matrix. \code{sig_diag}
is the estimate of the column-wise variances so it must be of
length \code{ncol(Y)}. The default is the function
\code{pca_naive} that just uses the first \code{r} singular
vectors as the estimate of \code{alpha}. The estimated
variances are just the column-wise mean square.}

\item{fa_args}{A list. Additional arguments you want to pass to
fa_func.}
}
\description{
This function will perform a variant of Removing Unwanted Variation
2-step (RUV2) (Gagnon-Bartsch et al, 2013), where we include a
variance inflation parameter in the second step and estimate it by
maximum likelihood.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{vruv4}} for a description of the model.

The variances of the non-control genes using the adjustment for
RUV2 are unchanged. The variances for the control genes are the
ones that are inflated. Hence, for this method to adjust the
variances of the genes of interest (the non-control genes) you must
use hierarchical shrinkage of the variances. That is, you must set
\code{limmashrink = TRUE}.
